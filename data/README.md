## The folder `data`

### Why is this folder empty?

We use the folder **`data`** to store large expression datasets, in addition to corresponding clinical (and outcome) data, that are required for figure generation in the Shiny app. Because large files cannot be hosted on Github, these data are stored in the Meshinchi lab's AWS bucket. Consequently, this folder should appear empty on GitHub, but you will see it referenced in the Shiny app code.
