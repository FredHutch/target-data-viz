# TARGET Data Visualization Tools

This directory contains the necessary code to visualize gene expression and outcome data from various Children's Oncology Group (COG) pediatric AML cohorts. These data can be explored interactively via an R Shiny app.

All mRNA gene expression values are in transcripts per million (TPM). 
All miRNA expression values are in reads per million mapped reads (RPM) and were annotated using miRbase v21 annotations.

The scripts & app are created and maintained by Amanda Leonti in Soheil Meshinchi's lab.
