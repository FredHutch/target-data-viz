# TARGET Data Visualization Tools

This directory contains the necessary code to visualize gene expression and outcome data from various Children's Oncology Group (COG) pediatric AML cohorts, by way of an R Shiny app (please see [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for more info about Shiny, if you aren't familiar). 

These data can be explored interactively with the Shiny app.

## Access

*Please Note*: The app is password protected - contact the app creator (aleonti@fredhutch.org) to be granted access.

## The data

All mRNA gene expression values are in transcripts per million (TPM). All miRNA expression values are in reads per million mapped reads (RPM) and were annotated using miRbase v21 annotations. These data are only available for the TARGET AML cohort. 

Please see the respective publications for each dataset for more information:

- [Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682338/)

## Problems?

Please file an issue if you encounter any problems, bugs, or have suggestions for improving the app. We'd love to hear your feedback!

The scripts & app are created and maintained by Amanda Leonti in Soheil Meshinchi's lab.
