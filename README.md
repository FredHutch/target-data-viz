# Meshinchi Lab Data Visualization App

Welcome to the Meshinchi Lab's Shiny Application. With our app, you can interactively explore gene expression data for thousands of individual AML, ALL, T-ALL and Cell Line samples all in one place and create visualizations on-the-fly.

## The data

The main data for the application includes paired gene expression, mutation and survival data.  

Please see the respective publications for each dataset for more information:

- [TARGET](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/target/studied-cancers/acute-myeloid-leukemia)
- [Beat AML Master Trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30333627/)
- [Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682338/)
- [TCGA LAML](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1301689)

*All mRNA gene expression values are in transcripts per million (TPM). All miRNA expression values are in reads per million mapped reads (RPM) and were annotated using miRbase v21 annotations. These data are only available for the TARGET AML cohort.*
