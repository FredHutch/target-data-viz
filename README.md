# TARGET Data Visualization Tools

This directory contains the necessary files to visualize gene expression and outcome data from various Children's Oncology Group study cohorts. This data can be accessed interactively via a [Shiny app](https://meshinchi-data-viz.fredhutch.org/).

All gene expression values are in transcripts per million (TPM).

The scripts & R Shiny app were created by Amanda Leonti in Soheil Meshinchi's lab. The app is password portected - contact Amanda (aleonti@fredhutch.org) to be granted access.
