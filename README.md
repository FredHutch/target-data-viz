# TARGET Data Visualization Tools

This directory contains the necessary files to visualize and perform basic analysis on the TARGET AAML1031 data via a Shiny app. 

The cohort used in this app contains:

- 1,066 *de novo* diagnostic pediatric AML samples (patients range from <0 to ~30 years old)
- 68 bulk tissue normal/healthy bone marrow samples 
- 16 sorted CD34+ normal/healthy bone marrow samples

All gene expression values are in transcripts per million (TPM).

The scripts & corresponding R Shiny app was created by Amanda Leonti in Soheil Meshinchi's lab.
